RCMP said it appeared he wandered into the area where the mother and cub were feeding on a dead deer.[31]  Brown bear\\n153                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While on a hunting trip near Norman Wells, Novotny was charged and struck by a bear. Friends reported Novotny had just killed a moose and was prepping his prize when the bear \"came out of nowhere.\" He died on the scene. Authorities later found and killed the bear responsible for his death.[30]  Brown bear\\n154                                                                                   Patel was about to begin hiking with four friends in\\xa0Apshawa Preserve\\xa0when they met a man and a woman at the entrance who told them there was a bear nearby and advised them to turn around.[12]\\xa0They continued on, found the bear, and Patel and another hiker took photos. They turned and began walking away, but the bear followed them. The hikers ran in different directions, and found that Patel was missing when they regrouped. Authorities found Patel\\'s body after searching for two hours. A black bear found in the vicinity was killed and a necropsy revealed human remains in its digestive tract.[13]\\xa0According to the State Department of Environmental Protection, this was the first fatal bear attack on a human in New Jersey on record.[14]  Black bear\\n155                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Ward was killed by a bear while he slept near the fire pit at his campsite. His fiancée who slept in a nearby motorhome discovered his body the following morning. The bear was later shot and killed by conservation officers.[10][11]  Black bear\\n156  Crosby, an employee at a medical clinic in the park, was reported missing when he did not report for work. A park ranger found his body in a popular off-trail area less than a mile (1\\xa0600\\xa0m) from Elephant Back Loop Trail, an area he was known to frequent. His body was partially consumed and covered. Puncture wounds on his arms indicated he had tried to defend himself. Based on the presence of a sow grizzly and a cub in the area, the sow was deemed responsible for the attack. The sow was captured and killed after it was found to be the bear that killed Crosby.[27][28]\\xa0There were public appeals to not kill the sow, but the park superintendent decided there was a risk the sow might kill again; based on July 6, 2011 and August 24, 2011 killings in the park, where another sow was present at both those killings.[29]  Brown bear\\n157                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Treat and another man were on mountain bikes on U.S. Forest Service land near Halfmoon Lakes. According to the official Board of Review report on the incident, Treat\\'s mountain bike collided at high speed with a large male grizzly bear \"after rounding a blind curve in the trail.\" The bear immediately attacked Treat in response to being struck by the bicycle. The second rider escaped uninjured and summoned help. The bear was identified via DNA from a previous research project, but was not captured or killed because its behavior was a natural response to a surprise encounter involving physical contact.[26]  Brown bear\\n158                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cooper was chased and mauled by a bear while running in the juniors\\' division of the Bird Ridge trail\\'s running race. Cooper texted his family after completing the race, to say he was being followed by a bear. Searchers found the runner\\'s remains 500 yards (457\\xa0m) from the trail and shot the bear in the face with a shotgun, which scared the bear and forced him into the woods away from the body.[9]  Black bear\\n159                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Johnson, a contract employee for Pogo Mine, was killed while collecting soil samples.

The man, identified as 31-year-old Aaron Gibbons from\\xa0Arviat, put himself between the children and the bear and was attacked, causing fatal injuries. The bear was killed by other people who were also in the area.[52][53]  Polar Bear\\n162                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Uptain, a guide for Martin Outfitters, was cleaning an elk that he and his client Corey Chubon had shot when the bear attacked. The bear was a sow with a 1½-year-old male cub.[22]\\xa0As the bear attacked Uptain, Chubon attempted to throw him his Glock pistol but Uptain failed to catch it. Chubon fled with injuries as the bear attacked Uptain. After staggering 50 yards (46\\xa0m) uphill from the dead elk, Uptain was killed by the mother and possibly by the cub as well.
